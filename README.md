## Features

- **MRI Scan Analysis**: Upload brain MRI scans to detect presence of tumors
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Identifies four categories:
  - Glioma
  - Meningioma
  - Pituitary Tumor
  - No Tumor
- **Detailed Information**: Provides comprehensive details about each tumor type
- **Interactive UI**: Drag-and-drop interface with real-time feedback
- **Educational Content**: Learn about different brain tumor types and characteristics
- **Visitor Statistics**: Tracks unique visitors and total visits for analytics

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Flask-HTTPAuth
- **Image Processing**: PIL, NumPy
- **Analytics**: Custom visitor tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mo-Abdalkader/Brain-Tumor.git
   cd Brain Tumor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained model:
   - Create a `models` directory in the project root
   - Place the trained model file (`final_model.keras`) in the `models` directory

5. Create required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p static/uploads
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Upload an MRI scan through the interface:
   - Drag and drop an image file
   - Or click to browse and select a file

4. View the analysis results:
   - Tumor classification
   - Confidence level
   - Detailed information about the detected condition
   - Recommendations for next steps

## Admin Dashboard

Access visitor statistics through the admin dashboard:

1. Navigate to `/stats`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. View metrics including:
   - Total visits
   - Unique visitors
   - Current online users
   - IP-based statistics

### Model Details

The deep learning model uses a convolutional neural network architecture trained on a dataset of MRI scans. It achieves classification by identifying patterns in brain tissue that correspond to different tumor types.

## Security Features

- Password-protected admin dashboard
- Secure file uploads with validation
- Temporary file storage with automatic cleanup
- Session management for visitor tracking
